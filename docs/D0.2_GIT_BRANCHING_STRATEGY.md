# D0.2 Git Branching Strategy

Date: 2026-02-12  
Project: Educator MVP

## Purpose

This document defines the repository branching model for Sprint 7 onward.

## Branch Model

- `main`: production-ready code only.
- `develop`: integration branch for completed feature work.
- `feature/<sprint>-<scope>`: short-lived implementation branches.
- `hotfix/<scope>`: urgent fixes that must reach production quickly.

## Current Initialization

- `main` branch exists.
- `develop` branch created from `main` on 2026-02-12.

## Naming Convention

- Sprint feature work: `feature/s7-auth-guard`, `feature/s8-security-headers`
- Bug fix work: `feature/s7-fix-enrollment-drop`
- Hotfix work: `hotfix/login-500`

## Workflow

1. Create feature branch from `develop`.
2. Implement and validate locally (`lint`, `test`, build, API checks when applicable).
3. Open PR into `develop` with scope and validation evidence.
4. Merge to `develop` after review.
5. Release by merging `develop` into `main` with release notes.

## Protected Merge Rules (recommended)

- No direct commits to `main`.
- Require PR review for `develop` and `main`.
- Require passing CI checks before merge.
- Use squash merge for feature branches.

## Local Commands

```powershell
# From repository root
"C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe" checkout main
"C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe" branch develop main
"C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe" checkout develop
"C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe" checkout -b feature/s7-example-task
```
